<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><p style="text-align: center;">What is life?</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All living things share life processes. Scientists use the <strong>seven life processes</strong> to determine if something is living or not.</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The 7 characteristics of life</span></h3>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Movement(internal and external)</strong> - All living things move, such as animals walking and plant parts that move to track the sun&rsquo;s movement.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
	<li><strong>Respiration</strong> - A chemical reaction that happens in cells to release energy from food.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
	<li><strong>Sensitivity (adaption and sense)</strong> - Ability to detect changes in your surroundings and respond to them, changes such as light, temperature, water, PH etc&hellip;</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
	<li><strong>Growth (increase in the number of cells)</strong> - Involves using food to produce new cells.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
	<li><strong>Reproduction</strong> &ndash; The ability of organisms to reproduce and pass genetic characteristics to their offspring.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
	<li><strong>Excretion</strong> - Living things produce waste as a result of chemical reactions happening in the cell. Waste products needs to be disposed before they become toxic to the cells.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="7">
	<li><strong>Nutrition (Autotroph and Heterotroph)</strong> &ndash; Nutrition is the intake and use of nutrients from the surroundings, which are used for growth and providing energy. Nutrition happens in different ways with different living things.</li>
</ol>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cells of living organisms</span></h3>
<p>All living organisms are made up of cells (smallest part of a living organism). There are two main types of organisms based on the structure of the cell, with the biggest difference being the presence of the nucleus. Cells containing a nucleus are eukaryotic cells and cells without a nucleus are prokaryotic cells.</p>
<p>Eukaryotic cells make up organisms such as plants and animals Eg: bacteria. Cells are the basic structural and functional units of all living organisms. The cell is microscopic in size which means that it cannot be seen except with a microscope. Organisms are made up of different cells, which are specialized to perform a specific function. Depending on the function it can specialize by having a different size and shape. E.g.: nerve cells and red blood cells have different functions in a body, so their structures are different.</p>
<p>Components of the structure that are common to all cells include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Cell membrane</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Nucleus</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Cytoplasm</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Cell membrane</strong></span></h4>
<p>Every cell has a cell membrane around it, it is a thin layer that encloses and separates it from its surroundings. The cell membrane controls which substances are allowed to come in and out the cell. It is selectively permeable (allows liquids and gases to pass through it).</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Cytoplasm</strong></span></h4>
<p>The cytoplasm is the jelly -like substance in a cell. It consists of water, with a collection of structures and materials which are dissolved or suspended. Cytoplasm provides a liquid balance for all the chemical reactions in the cell.</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nucleus<strong></strong></span></h4>
<p>Plant and animal cells have a nucleus in the cytoplasm, which controls processes and chemical reactions that occur in the cell. It also contains the cells genetic material, that is organized into DNA molecules.</p>

<p>The difference between eukaryotic cells and prokaryotic cells: Eukaryotic cells have a nucleus that contains the genetic material surrounded by a membrane. Prokaryotic DNA floats in the cytoplasm with no membrane.</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Energy</strong></span></h3>
<p>Life isn&rsquo;t possible without energy</p>
